- Hi, I’m @full-elevator,
- I’m currently learning Python. I use it to automate tedious tasks like styling HTML and making subtitles.
- Though not a serious programmer, I try to make and maintain a few small media editing projects. Sometimes I fail badly.
- Please help me correct grammatical errors in my docs if you see any.

我敲中文很慢，正好中文和英文说的都不好，注释什么的就全写英文了。
